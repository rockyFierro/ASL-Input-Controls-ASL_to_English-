# ASL Input Controls
Using translations made possible by the work of Nichola Renotte and Priyanjali Gupta; Uses handsigns detected by Tensorflow object detection and maps them to custom commands as an alternative to keyboards and videogame controllers.

Built on top of  priiyaanjaalii0611/ASL_to_English
Reads your hand signs and translates them to English words using Tensorflow object detection API<br>
The model is built using transfer learning from pretrained model ssd_mobilenet model<br>
The dataset is made manually by running the __*Image Collection python file*__ that collects images from your webcam for all the mentioned below signs in the American Sign Language :<br>
